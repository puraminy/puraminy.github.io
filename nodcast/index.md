<h1>Introducing NodCast: A Text-Based Reading Experience</h1>

<section>
  <h2>What is NodCast?</h2>
  <p>Before reading the document, press h to learn how to move between segments. Navigation mainly uses the arrow keys.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How does it do that?</h2>
  <p>NodCast is built for focused reading. It supports readers in maintaining concentration and helps writers create coherent, deliberate articles.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What exactly are nods?</h2>
  <p>Instead of passively scanning lines, you interact with each sentence through short written signals called nods.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What kinds of nods can I choose from?</h2>
  <p>A nod is a quick written acknowledgment—similar to saying I see or hmm—but expressed in text rather than speech.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Can I add custom nods?</h2>
  <p>NodCast includes two broad types: affirming nods like I get it, and reflective ones like not sure or wait, what?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Are there other types of feedbacks?</h2>
  <p>You can edit or create your own nods at any time. Custom nods allow NodCast to better recognize and adapt to your reading style.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How NodCast uses thes feedbacks?</h2>
  <p>Beyond nods, you can also enter questions while reading each segment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>So nods become a feedback signal to the system itself?</h2>
  <p>NodCast learns which parts engage you and which parts confuse you by observing your nods and questions. These signals are shared with article creators. Articles are also scored, and you can browse top-rated ones. Future versions may adapt pacing, difficulty, or provide targeted explanations based on your nod history.</p>
